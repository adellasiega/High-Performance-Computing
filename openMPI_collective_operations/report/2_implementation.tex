\section{Implementation}

For each operation we vary the algorithm used to perform the operation. Other parameters that are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{message size}, the size of the message that is sent;
    \item \textbf{number of processes}, the number of processes that are involved in the operation;
    \item \textbf{\texttt{--map-by}}, the mapping of the processes to the nodes;
\end{itemize}

For each run we set 10000 repetitions and we take the average of the time taken to perform the operation. The time is measured in seconds. We also set a warm-up phase of 10000 repetitions.
